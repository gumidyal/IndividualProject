This semester was an especially difficult one with all the challenges experienced, it was an unusual few months. However, I still feel as though I have been able to showcase what I have learned this semester through this app. The app is fairly basic, but I am still very proud of it! Because despite all that has happened, I was able to create a cute webpage that allows students to create note files for class. The app includes a form and the user can edit or delete the note. The webpage started as fairly inconsistent, but after I was able to get feedback, the whole app is better understood and more cohesive.
